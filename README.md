# havenCloud
A cloud platform that initiates e2ee on day 1 with advanced security to protect data. 


# HAVEN

**HAVEN** is the start of something massive — a secure, revenue-first alternative to big platforms like Dropbox and Threads. Built raw, fast, and without outside investors, HAVEN is a platform for users who want control, trust, and simplicity.

# CURRENT STATUS

This is the earliest version of HAVEN. It’s **very buggy** right now — core features like navigation, file storage, and payments are barely working or broken altogether. This is not a polished app. It’s the foundation.

But it’s live. It exists. And it’s being built in public.

# WHY HAVEN EXISTS

- To break away from insecure, bloated platforms
- To ship fast, build raw, and move without permission
- To prove you don’t need outside investors or AI to build something great
- To show that “impossible” just means “you gave up too early”

## 🧠 WHAT HAVEN WILL DO

HAVEN is designed to become:

- A secure digital storage and sharing platform
- A privacy-first space where users own their data
- A clean, fast, minimal tool — built around speed, not bloat
- A product that earns real revenue and grows without VC money

# TECH STACK (So far)

VITE, REACTJS, NODEJS, SUPABASE & TAILWINDCSS

# NEXT UP

- Fix navigation bugs  
- Make file upload + storage functional  
- Add working payment system  
- Polish UI to match brand  
- Launch private referrals system  
- Improve security and stability  

# BUILDER NOTES

HAVEN is being built solo, around a full-time schedule and through brain fog. But everything built is still my vision, my grind, and my work.

This isn’t just an app. This is a challenge to everything bloated, overfunded, and insecure.

**Follow the build.** Watch it evolve.
